<h3>Welcome to the survey on the use of multimedia databases for emotion elicitation.</h3>

<b>Summary:</b> The survey examined how researchers in psychology, neurology, cognitive science, and related fields use multimedia stimuli databases to stimulate emotional responses.

Affective picture databases provide a standardized set of images to elicit controlled and consistent emotional responses in research participants. They are a valuable tool for studying various emotion-related phenomena across several research domains. These domains include emotion perception, emotion regulation, and the neural basis of emotion. However, affective picture databases have diverse schemas, structures, and content that make them difficult to use. 

Traditionally, creating personalized sequences targeted at specific semantic cues and emotional responses istime-consuming and professionaly challenging. As a result, this work is almost always accomplished manually and requires a high level of expertise and professional knowledge.

This survey aimed to identify common patterns in using multimedia databases for emotion elicitation (i.e., multimedia stimuli databases). 

This survey followed up on a similar research undertaken precisely ten years ago, and published in the Proceedings of 36th International Convention on Information and Communication Technology, Electronics and Microelectronics MIPRO 2013: https://www.bib.irb.hr/622474

<b>Results:</b> The survey identified a need for novel data observatory software. This finding motivates the authors' intention to develop and validate such software platform that relies on AI. Such a platform would describe better, retrieve, and integrate various semi-structured affective multimedia datasets. The results prominently indicate the overwhelming dissatisfaction regarding stimuli content diversity and cultural bias, specifically regarding emotional and semantic context. The main driver of satisfaction from users of existing automated retrieval software is the quality of semantic descriptors available, which points the direction AI should take in novel data observatory software. 

<b>Aviability:</b> The aggregated results of the survey will remain publicly shared with the scientific community in this repository.
