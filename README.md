Welcome to the survey on the use of multimedia databases for emotion elicitation.

The survey examined how researchers in psychology, neurology, cognitive science, and related fields use multimedia stimuli databases to stimulate emotional responses.

Traditionally, creating personalized sequences targeted at specific semantic cues and emotional responses takes much time. As a result, this work is almost always accomplished manually and requires a high level of expertise and professional knowledge.

This survey aimed to identify common patterns in using multimedia databases for emotion elicitation (i.e., multimedia stimuli databases). We will publicly share the aggregated results of the survey with the scientific community in a free-access publication.

The survey followed up on research undertaken precisely ten years ago, and published in the Proceedings of 36th International Convention on Information and Communication Technology, Electronics and Microelectronics MIPRO 2013: https://www.bib.irb.hr/622474
